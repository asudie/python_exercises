def decide(answers, respiration, heart_rate, blushing, pupil_size):
    """
    Decide whether the subject is a human or a replicant based on their answers and physiological data.

    The function applies simple logic to evaluate a subject's responses and physical indicators (respiration, heart rate, 
    blushing level, and pupil dilation) and returns a result based on the calculated human score.

    Args:
        answers (list): A list of user responses (e.g., 'Yes' or 'No').
        respiration (int): The subject's respiration rate in breaths per minute.
        heart_rate (int): The subject's heart rate in beats per minute.
        blushing (int): The subject's blushing level (typically on a scale of 1 to 6).
        pupil_size (int): The subject's pupil size in millimeters.

    Returns:
        bool: Returns True if the subject is identified as human, False if identified as a replicant.
    
    Notes:
        - A higher heart rate and abnormal pupil size or respiration rates negatively affect the human score.
        - A positive answer ('Yes') in the questionnaire increases the human score.
        - The subject is considered a replicant if the human score is not high enough (below 6).
